**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of **classes** and **objects**. Let’s explore it further:

**Definition**:

- OOP structures a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints called **classes**.
- These classes are used to create individual **instances of objects**.
- Each object combines **data** (in the form of fields or attributes) and **code** (in the form of methods or procedures).

**Key Concepts**:

- **Classes**: Represent templates or blueprints for creating objects. They define attributes and behaviors.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes. Each object has its own state (data) and can perform actions (methods).
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (attributes) and methods together within a class.
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their properties.
- **Polymorphism**: Objects of different classes can be treated uniformly through common interfaces.

**Example**:

- Imagine a **Car** class:
  - Attributes: Make, Model, Year
  - Methods: StartEngine(), Accelerate(), Brake()
- You can create multiple **Car** objects (instances) with specific data.

**Benefits of OOP**:

- **Modularity**: Code is organized into manageable units (classes).
- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across projects.
- **Abstraction**: Hides complex implementation details.
- **Maintenance**: Changes to one class don’t affect others.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new features by extending classes.
